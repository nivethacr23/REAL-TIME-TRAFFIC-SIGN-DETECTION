# REAL-TIME-TRAFFIC-SIGN-DETECTION
This project detects red, yellow, and green traffic signals in real-time using a webcam. It uses OpenCV and NumPy to process video frames and identify signal colors, ideal for smart traffic systems and autonomous driving prototypes.
Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop a real-time traffic signal detection system using computer vision techniques. By utilizing a webcam feed and processing each frame through color detection in the HSV color space, the system identifies red, yellow, and green traffic signals. This project aims to demonstrate how real-time image processing can be applied to detect traffic lights, which is a foundational step toward building intelligent transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and driver assistance technologies. The main objective is to enhance road safety and situational awareness by enabling machines to recognize and react to traffic signals just like human drivers.

Technologies Used:
Python – Core programming language used for implementation.

OpenCV – Open-source computer vision library for image processing and real-time video analysis.

NumPy – Library used for numerical operations and handling arrays, especially in color range definitions.

HSV Color Space – Used for effective color segmentation of red, yellow, and green traffic lights.

Webcam (via OpenCV VideoCapture) – For capturing real-time video input for processing.

Libraries Used:
OpenCV (cv2) – For image processing, contour detection, color space conversion, and drawing shapes/text.

NumPy (numpy) – For creating and managing arrays, especially used in defining HSV color ranges for red, yellow, and green.

These lightweight yet powerful libraries enable real-time video processing and make it easy to build computer vision applications.

Usage of This Project:
This project can be used to detect red, yellow, and green traffic signals in real-time using a webcam feed. It's ideal for:

Prototyping autonomous driving systems – Helps simulate how a vehicle might recognize and respond to traffic signals.

Driver assistance technologies – Can be integrated into systems that alert drivers about current traffic signal states.

Smart traffic monitoring – Useful in traffic control centers to detect signal changes and manage traffic flow.

Educational and research purposes – A great starting point for students and researchers exploring computer vision in transportation.

The project demonstrates how real-time image processing and color detection can be applied to practical road scenarios using minimal hardware and open-source tools.
